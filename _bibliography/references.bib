@article{WuSmith2016,
abstract = {This study examines the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude circulation response to Arctic amplification (AA) in a simple atmospheric general circulation model. It is found that, in response to AA, the tropospheric jet shifts equatorward and the stratospheric polar vortex weakens, robustly for various AA forcing strengths. Despite this, no statistically significant change in the frequency of sudden stratospheric warming events is identified. In addition, in order to quantitatively assess the role of stratosphere-troposphere coupling, the tropospheric pathway is isolated by nudging the stratospheric zonal mean state toward the reference state. When the nudging is applied, rendering the stratosphere inactive, the tropospheric jet still shifts equatorward but by approximately half the magnitude compared to that of an active stratosphere. The difference represents the stratospheric pathway and the downward influence of the stratosphere on the troposphere. This suggests that stratosphere-troposphere coupling plays a nonnegligible role in establishing the midlatitude circulation response to AA.},

@article{PrevidiEtAl2015,
abstract = {The authors evaluate 23 coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models from phase 5 of CMIP (CMIP5) in terms of their ability to simulate the observed climatological mean energy budget of the Antarctic atmosphere. While the models are shown to capture the gross features of the energy budget well [e.g., the observed two-way balance between the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) net radiation and horizontal convergence of atmospheric energy transport], the simulated TOA absorbed shortwave (SW) radiation is too large during austral summer. In the multimodel mean, this excessive absorption reaches approximately 10 W m-2, with even larger biases (up to 25-30 W m-2) in individual models. Previous studies have identified similar climate model biases in the TOA net SW radiation at Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes and have attributed these biases to errors in the simulated cloud cover. Over the Antarctic, though, model cloud errors are of secondary importance, and biases in the simulated TOA net SW flux are instead driven mainly by biases in the clear-sky SW reflection. The latter are likely related in part to the models' underestimation of the observed annual minimum in Antarctic sea ice extent, thus underscoring the importance of sea ice in the Antarctic energy budget. Finally, substantial differences in the climatological surface energy fluxes between existing observational datasets preclude any meaningful assessment of model skill in simulating these fluxes.},
